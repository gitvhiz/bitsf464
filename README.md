# Final Project for the course BITS F464: Machine Learning

This contains my final project towards partial fulfilment of the course `BITS F464: Machine Learning` conducted at BITS Pilani, K.K Birla Goa Campus in the First Semester, 2023-24

It is recommended to use Python 3.10+ and upwards while running the notebook for this project.

The dataset for the project can be downloaded using the following command:

`wget https://storage.googleapis.com/bitsf464project/final_project.zip`

And then unzipping the file to get one `train.csv` file, one `test.csv` file and a `sample_submission.csv` file.

`unzip final_project.zip`

All external packages and libraries employed for this project are in a `requirements.txt` file appended to this repository.
